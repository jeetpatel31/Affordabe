I've created a straightforward and accessible website designed to help people easily calculate whether they can afford major purchases like cars and houses, along with what their monthly payments might look like. Here’s what my website offers from my perspective:

Ease of Use: I focused on making the website easy to navigate, ensuring that users can find what they need without any hassle. Whether someone is looking to buy a car or a house, they can simply select the option they're interested in and start inputting their financial details right away.
Instant Calculations: I’ve integrated advanced financial formulas that work behind the scenes, providing users with real-time calculations. This means that as soon as someone enters their details, they can see how much they can afford to spend or what their monthly payments might be, adapting instantly to different purchasing scenarios.
Comprehensive and Flexible: My website is built to offer a wide range of calculations. Users can find out their monthly car payments based on the purchase price, down payment, and interest rate, or understand how much house they can afford based on their income and existing debts. I made sure to include considerations like sales tax, trade-in values, and loan terms for a fuller picture.
Future-Ready: While the current focus is on cars and houses, I've designed the site with expansion in mind. I plan to add more options in the future, broadening the range of purchasing decisions the tool can assist with.
In short, my goal was to create a tool that takes the complexity out of financial planning for significant investments, making it as user-friendly as possible. Whether planning for a dream home or the next car, my website is here to help users navigate their financial planning with confidence and ease.
